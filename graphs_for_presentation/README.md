This project explores the relationship between divorce rates and annual working hours across different countries.
The analysis uses publicly available datasets, merges them, and produces multiple visualizations for comparison.
Originally created as part of a group presentation, with many graphs produced (only some used in the final slides).

Features
Loads and cleans datasets using pandas
Merges time-series data for divorce rates and annual working hours
Generates line plots, comparison graphs, and country-specific visualizations
Flexible selection of countries for multi-country comparison
Produces publication-ready plots using Matplotlib
Supports additional graphs (beyond the ones used in the presentation)
